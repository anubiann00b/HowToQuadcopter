## What Not to Do.

Here's a small list of things not to do:

 * Strip motor wires.

   With a brushless motor, each of the three wires has a bunch of strands. Each of those strands leads to its own coil, so their all individually insulated. At the end, there's no insulation, and the strands are twisted together. If you cut it, you leave your motor pretty much useless.

 * Reverse polarity to the board.

   You'll fry the board.

 * Reverse polarity to the ESC's.

   Take a guess-- You'll fry the ESC. It will sparkle and smoke. If you're thinking "OOH FIREWORKS" unplug it.

 * Use crimp connectors or other modular wiring components.

   It might seem easier to use crimp connectors for wiring. It's not. Just solder everything. If something goes wrong, desolder it and replace it. It's actually a lot easier than using crimp connectors. They also make it a pain to wire stuff.

 * Cut wires too short.

   "Measure twice, cut once." Here it's think twice, buy replacement parts never. Nothing sucks more than buying replacements for perfectly functioning components.

 * Don't fry your board.

   It's a lot easier than it sounds. Simply grounding pins can destroy your board. Read [10 Ways to Destroy an Arduino](http://www.ruggedcircuits.com/10-ways-to-destroy-an-arduino/).
